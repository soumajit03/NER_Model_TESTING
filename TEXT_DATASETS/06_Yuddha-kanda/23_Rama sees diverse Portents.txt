The elder brother of Lakshmana beheld certain portents and as their significance was known to him, he embraced Saumitri and said:â€”
"O Lakshmana, occupying this region provided with fresh water, and woods abounding in fruit, let us speedily divide these innumerable forces and form ourselves into battalions 1 Great is the danger I foresee, boding destruction to the world and the slaughter of the valiant bears, monkeys and titans.
"A dust storm is blowing up, the earth trembles and the peaks of the mountains shake; trees fall, clouds resembling wild beasts emit a terrible roaring and let loose dreadful showers mingled with blood; there is an awe-inspiring twilight, lurid like unto red sandalwood; from the blazing sun, a circle of fire falls; filled with terror, wild beasts and birds with harsh voices are raising mournful cries to the sun on every side. In the night, the moon, bereft of brilliance, burning with a black and red halo as it rises, resembles the destruction threatening the world. A dark stain appears on the solar disc which is diminished, sombre, without radiance and coppery. Behold, O Lakshmana, a thick dust blots out the stars and seems to foreshadow the end of the world! Crows, eagles and vultures fall wheeling, whilst jackals inspiring the greatest terror emit sinister howls. Rocks, maces and spears, hurled by the monkeys and demons, cover the earth which has become a morass of flesh and blood.
"Without delay, attended by all the monkeys, let us, this very day, attack this city difficult of access of which Ravana is the support!"
Thus spoke the Archer Rama, the subduer of the foe in conflict, and, bearing his bow and arrows, he set forth in the direction of Lanka.
Thereupon all the valiant monkeys with Bibishana and Sugriva at their head rose up crying destruction on their powerful foe and the boisterous demonstration of those heroic monkeys, made with the object of pleasing Rama, filled that son of the House of Raghu with delight.
