Retracing their steps on hearing the voice of Angada, all those huge-bodied monkeys, resolutely taking their stand, desired nothing more than to join issue in the fight.
Their confidence restored by the words of the valiant Angada, those monkeys, feeling their energy revived and their courage mounting, advanced, resolving to die and sacrifice their fives. Then those giants, arming themselves with trees and enormous crags, which they spun with great rapidity, hurled themselves on Kumbhakarna, whereupon, full of ire and vigour, that warrior of immense stature, brandishing his mace, dispersed the enemy on every side. Seven hundred and eight thousand monkeys lay scattered on the earth struck down by Kumbhakarna and, like unto Garuda consuming serpents, he seized hold of seven, eight, ten, twenty and thirty in his arms, crushing and devouring them in his extreme fury as he ran.
Re-assured with exceeding difficulty, those monkeys rallied here and there and, armed with trees and rocks, took up their stand in the forefront of the battle. At that instant, Dvivida, that lion among monkeys, resembling a threatening cloud, tearing up a rock, hurled himself on the enemy who was like unto a mountain peak; and that monkey, breaking off the crag, flung it at Kumbhakarna, missing him, so that the missile fell on the titan force, crushing horses, elephants and chariots harnessed to excellent steeds. Another rock created further victims and, under that avalanche of stones, the titans wounded, their horses slain, their charioteers struck down, streaming with blood and mounted in theii cars, suddenly let forth terrible cries and with the aid of death-dealing arrows, severed the heads of those foremost of monkeys who were roaring.
On their side, the monkeys, full of valour, uprooted great trees in order to crush the chariots, horses, elephants, buffalo and titans and, from the air where he was stationed, Hanuman showered rocks, stones and trees of every kind on the head of Kumbhakarna but that mighty one split and evaded that rain of trees. And he hurled himself upon that great army of monkeys brandishing his sharp pick and, as he rushed forward Hanuman placed himself in the way armed with the peak of a mountain, and, in fury struck Kumbhakama a violent blow, who, in his appalling corpulence, appeared like a hill! Then he whose limbs were dripping with fat and streaming with blood, stumbled under the shock and the titan hurled his spear, which was as bright as lightning and like a mountain spouting forth flames, striking Maruti between the arms, as Guha formerly struck the Krauncha Mountain with his formidable lance. His breast pierced by that spear, beside himself, vomiting blood, Hanuman, in fury, let forth a terrible cry in the midst of the battle, like the roar of a thundercloud at the end of the World Period, and a great cheer arose from the ranks of the titans as they beheld his plight, whilst the monkeys, distraught and terrified, fled from the field.
At that instant, summoning up his courage, the valiant Nila discharged a crag against that crafty titan, who, seeing it approaching, struck it with his fist and, on the impact, that rock broke and fell on the earth emitting sparks of fire. Then Rishabha, Sharabha, Nila, Gavaksha and Gandamadhana, those five tigers among the monkeys, hurled themselves on Kumbhakama and, in the struggle, showered him with blows from stones, trees, the palms of their hands, feet and fists, attacking that giant on every side. Kumbhakarna, however, scarcely felt those blows and, unheeding, seized the impetuous Rishabha in his two arms. Crushed in this embrace, that bull among the monkeys fell to the ground, his mouth filled with blood.
Thereafter, in the fight, that enemy of Indra struck Sharabha with his fist, Nila with his knee and Gavaksha with the palm of his hand. Dazed by the blows they had received, terrified, covered with blood, they fell on the earth like Kimshuka Trees that have been uprooted. Those powerful leaders of the monkeys being overcome, the rest hurled themselves in thousands on Kumbhakama and, flinging themselves upon him and climbing about him as if he were a rock, those bulls among the Plavagas, who themselves resembled hills, attacked and bit him. With their nails, teeth, fists and arms, those foremost of monkeys assailed the valiant Kumbhakarna, a veritable tiger in stature, and that titan, covered by thousands of apes, resembled a mountain overgrown by trees. Crushing all those monkeys in his arms, that giant devoured them, as Garuda the serpents. Cast into Kumbhakarna's mouth, that resembled the pit of hell, the monkeys issued from his ears and nostrils. As high as a mountain in his rage he devoured those monkeys, and that prince of titans crushed them covering the earth with their flesh and blood and ranging through their ranks which he overran, so that he appeared like the Fire of Time itself. Resembling Shakra bearing the thunderbolt in his hand or Death with the noose, so did that powerful titan appear, armed with bis spear, in the fight. As in the summer season, fire destroys the dry forests, so did Kumbhakarna consume the simian ranks.
Thus decimated, their leaders struck down, the Plavamgamas, wild with terror, emitted dreadful cries and, overpowered again and again by Kumbhakarna, those monkeys fled for refuge to Raghava. Witnessing the massacre of those monkeys, Angada, born of the son of the Bearer of the Thunderbolt, hurled himself in rage upon Kumbhakarna in the struggle. Seizing hold of a great crag, he roared again and again, putting all the titans, who accompanied Kumbhakarna, to flight; thereafter he struck the head of his adversary with the rock, and that enemy of Indra inflamed with anger on receiving the blow, leapt with one bound upon the irascible son of Bali. Emitting loud cries, that titan struck terror among the monkeys and, in his anger, threw his spear with extreme force at Angada, but with a light bound, that valiant lion among the monkeys, an experienced warrior, avoided the impact and leapt on his opponent, striking his chest with the palm of his hand. That violent blow dazed the giant, who resembled a mountain, but regaining his senses that most powerful of titans, doubling his fist, with a mocking laugh, struck, Angada who fell insensible to the earth.
As that lion among the Plavagas lay stretched unconscious on the ground, Kumbhakarna, brandishing his spear, rushed on Sugriva and, seeing that colossus running towards him, the courageous King of the Monkeys went out to meet him whereupon, beholding that Indra among the Monkeys advancing, Kumbhakarna halted and stood facing him with braced limbs.
Beholding Kumbhakarna standing still, his body streaming with the blood of the great monkeys whom he had devoured, Sugriva said to him,"In slaying these warriors you have accomplished a most difficult feat and, by devouring my soldiers, hast acquired immense renown; now let the army of monkeys be, what hast you to do with common folk? Do you seek to bear the weight of this rock I am about to hurl on you, O Titan! Find your satisfaction in slaying me, O Titan, you who resemblest a mountain!"
At these words of the King of the Monkeys, who was possessed of courage and fortitude, that lion among the titans, answered,"You are the grandson of Prajapati and the son of Riksharajas, you are energetic and brave, hence thine arrogance, O Monkey!"
At these words of Kumbhakarna, Sugriva, taking up a stone, hurled it at him suddenly and struck his breast with that missile resembling a thunderbolt. The rock broke on the huge chest of that giant and the titans were appalled, whilst from the ranks of the monkeys rose shouts of joy. Struck by that rocky peak, Kumbhakarna, enraged, roared; opening his huge mouth wide and brandishing his spear, that resembled lightning, he hurled it at the King of the Monkeys and the Bears in order to slay him. As it fell, the son of Anila, Hanuman, with his two hands seized hold of that sharp spear and its gold-encircled shaft loosed by the titan's arm and, in play as it were, broke that powerful weapon across his knee.
Seeing his lance shattered to pieces by Hanuman, the army of monkeys, in a transport of delight, began to cheer. Meanwhile hearing those rangers of the woods emitting leonine roars and lauding Maruti in their joy, on beholding his spear shattered, that titan became enraged and, pale with fear, tore off a peak of the Malaya Mountain nearby, in the vicinity of Lanka, hurling it on Sugriva in order to strike him down. Struck by that crag, the Indra of the Monkeys fell on the earth insensible and the Yatudhanas let forth a roar of triumph.
Thereafter Kumbhakarna, approaching that powerful King of the Monkeys, lifted him up and bore him away like unto a violent wind driving away a cloud and, as he ranged the battlefield dragging Sugriva with him, who resembled a great cloud, Kumbhakarna, with his lofty stature, appeared like Mount Meru of exceedingly high peaks. Having laid hold of Sugriva, the mighty Lord of the Titans turned towards Lanka amidst the acclamations of his own people and the wailing of the Inhabitants of the Celestial Region, who were inconsolable on account of the capture of the King of the Plavamgamas and, having overcome the King of the Monkeys, that enemy of Indra and his rival in power, reflected,'He being dead, the entire simian host is destroyed together with Raghava!'
Then Hanuman, the sagacious son of Maruta, seeing Sugriva borne away by Kumbhakarna and the monkeys fleeing, thought to himself:
'Now that Sugriva has been made captive what ought I to do? Assuredly I shall accomplish that which is fitting; in order to slay this titan, I shall assume the shape of a mountain! When I have destroyed the extremely powerful Kumbhakarna in combat by pounding his body with blows and have delivered the king, the delight of the monkeys will be general! Yet that great monkey is well able to free himself though meseems, that, struck by Kumbhakarna with a rock in the struggle, the Chief of the Monkeys is not yet conscious of his plight. Presently, when Sugriva recovers consciousness, he will know how to save himself and the monkeys in this great conflict. That warrior will not be pleased if I deliver him, for his fair name would be tarnished and irretrievably lost. That is why I shall delay a while so that he may extricate himself from this predicament by his own prowess and I shall confine myself to rallying the scattered forces.'
Reflecting thus, Hanuman, born of Maruta, sought to instil courage into the simian army.
Meanwhile, bearing the great and quivering form of the monkey in his arms, Kumbhakarna returned to Lanka, and from the temples, highways, dwellings and city gates, die people honoured him with a rain of flowers. Under the shower of roasted grain and the fragrance of the blossoms with which he was drenched and also on account of the coolness of the royal highway, little by little the valiant Sugriva recovered consciousness. Borne in the arms of his powerful rival and, beholding the great highway of the city, that warrior was assailed by innumerable thoughts—'Taken captive in this way, what can I do now? I shall act in such a way that it is to the advantage of the monkeys.'
Then with his sharp nails, the King of the Monkeys, instantly attacked the enemy of the Gods and tore off his two ears with his teeth, biting off his nose and splitting his thighs with his feet.
With his nose and ears torn off by Sugriva's teeth and nails, Kumbhakama, transported with anger, his limbs covered with blood, threw die monkey down in order to crush him. Flung to the ground with fearful violence and struck by the Enemy of the Gods, Sugriva bounced into the air like a ball and with all speed flew to rejoin Rama.
Kumbhakama, his ears and nose severed, drenched in gore, shone like a mountain with its torrents and, covered with blood, vomiting blood, that gigantic titan of fearful aspect, the younger brother of Ravana, blazed with anger. Like unto a mass of dark collyrium or an evening cloud, that formidable Ranger of the Night resolved to enter into combat once more and, Sugriva having escaped, that enemy of Indra, furious, immediately threw himself into the straggle but reflecting 'I have no weapon' that ferocious warrior seized hold of a huge hammer. Issuing from the city, the valiant titan began to consume the redoubtable army of the monkeys with the violence of Fire at the destraction of the worlds. Famished and avid for flesh, Kumbhakama entered the ranks of the monkeys and, in his rage, like unto Mrityu at the end of the world period, indiscriminately ate up titan, monkey, Pisaca and bear. Thereafter in his fury, he consumed the monkeys, seizing one, two, three or more in one hand and titans also, thrusting them greedily into his mouth so that he streamed with flesh and blood and, though struck by the peaks of mountains, continued to feast on those monkeys, whilst they, seeing their companions being devoured, took refuge with Rama, whereupon Kumbhakama, in a transport of rage, pursued them in order to consume them. Seizing them in his arms, in the chase, he took hold of them in groups of seven, eight, twenty, thirty and a hundred; his limbs were covered with fat, flesh and blood, while wreaths of tangled entrails hung over his ears, and that colossus, of sharp teeth, began to discharge his weapons so that he appeared like Time at the end of the world.
At that instant, the son of Sumitra, the scourge of enemy hosts and the destroyer of hostile citadels, enraged, entered the fight and the courageous Lakshmana loosed seven darts into Kumbhakama's body, aiming a hail of other missiles on him but Kumbhakarna shook off those falling shafts. Then the valiant son of Sumitra was provoked beyond measure and covered the shining armour of that titan, that was made of gold, with his shafts, as a mountain is overlaid with clouds by the wind at evening. Like unto a mass of dark collyrium, that titan, riddled with golden darts, blazed like the sun shining amidst the clouds. And that terrible monster, whose voice equalled the crash of countless thunder-clouds, spoke scornfully, increasing Saumitri's delight, saying,"You have manifested your courage by entering into combat, fearlessly with me, I who have overcome Antaka himself without difficulty in the field! He who is able to face the rival of Mrityu himself, armed for combat, is worthy of honour, how much more so if he should enter into conflict with him! Mounted on Airavata surrounded by the Gods, Shakra, their king, has never dared to challenge me to battle. This courage from a youth is gratifying to me; now go hence, O Saumitri, I wish to meet Raghava!
"In sooth your valour, energy and martial prowess are pleasing to me but my only desire is to slay Rama, when he is slain, all are slain! When Rama has fallen under my blows, I shall fight with all my might against all those who remain on the battlefield!"
Thus boastfully did the titan speak and Saumitri, with a mocking smile, answered in dread accents saying,"That your prowess renders you invincible to Shakra and the other Gods is true, O Warrior, and to-day you dost manifest the same valour! Yonder is the son of Dasaratha immoveable as a rock!"
Hearing these words, that ranger of the night, the mighty and powerful Kumbhakarna, disregarding Lakshmana, passed him by and, causing the earth to tremble, rushed on Rama.
The son of Dasaratha, Rama, however, loosed some pointed arrows with Indra's weapon on Kumbhakama's breast and, wounded by Rama in his furious course, flames mixed with embers shot from his mouth! Pierced by Rama's arrow, that lion among the titans, emitting a terrible cry, hurled himself full of rage upon Raghava, throwing off the monkeys. With his breast pierced with darts, adorned with peacock's plumes, his mace fell shattered from his hand and all his weapons were scattered on the earth. Finding himself disarmed, that colossus created a great carnage with his fists and hands. Covered with blood, that streamed from his wounds, like a torrent falling from a mountain, his limbs riddled with arrows, maddened by the smell of blood, he rushed about in his violent rage devouring the monkeys, titans and bears. Brandishing a huge crag, that mighty and formidable giant, the equal of Antaka, hurled it at Rama but before it reached him, that hero struck it in the centre with the aid of seven infallible darts.
The virtuous Rama, elder brother of Bharata, shattered it with arrows encrusted with gold and, like unto the peak of Meru, that crag, shining with splendour, fell, crushing two hundred monkeys.
At that instant, the virtuous Lakshmana, after reflecting deeply on the various means of destroying Kumbhakarna, said to Rama:
"O Prince, that monster is no longer able to distinguish between monkeys and titans; drunk with the smell of blood, he devours friends and foes alike! Let the foremost of the monkeys climb upon him courageously and let their officers and leaders hang upon him on every side; under the heavy load that will crush him as he is rushing over the ground, that insensate one will annihilate the titans and not the monkeys."
At these words of that intelligent prince, the valiant monkeys all flung themselves on Kumbhakarna with alacrity and he, full of ire against the monkeys, who had climbed on his back, shook them violently as a fierce elephant his keepers. Seeing the titan shaking himself thus, Rama said to himself: 'He is incensed' and rushed upon him with his excellent bow. His eyes red with anger, the intrepid Raghava, consuming him with his glance as it were, bounded quickly forward, re-assuring the leaders, who were tormenting the mighty Kumbhakarna and, in order to encourage the monkeys, taking hold of his great bow encrusted with gold, that with its cord resembled a serpent, Rama advanced with his huge quiver full of arrows.
Surrounded by the monkey host, that warrior went forward full of valour, followed by Lakshmana and he beheld the illustrious and mighty Kumbhakarna, the vanquisher of his foes, surrounded by titans, his eyes inflamed, adorned with golden bracelets, pursuing all those monkeys with fury like unto one of the elephants of the four quarters; and he resembled the Vindhya or Mandara Mountains and was vomiting blood like a great cloud pouring down rain. With his tongue he licked the comers of his mouth that were wet with blood while he continued to destroy the simian army like Death at the end of the world.
Beholding that Prince of the Titans shining like a glowing bmkx, that lion among men stretched his bow, and the sound of that weapon infuriated that foremost of the titans, who, highly provoked, hurled himself on Raghava.
Meanwhile Rama, whose arms were like unto the great coils of the King of the Serpents, said to Kumbhakama who, possessing the splendour of a mountain, was rushing to attack him like a cloud driven by the tempest,"Come, O Prince of the Titans, tremble not, I await you bow in hand and in an instant will deprive you of life!"
'It is Rama!' reflected Kumbhakarna and, bursting forth into hideous laughter, rushed forward in fury, scattering the monkeys on the battlefield. By his monstrous and terrible laughter, like unto the muttering of a thundercloud, he seemed to cleave the hearts of the inhabitants of the woods, and Kumbhakarna, in his great splendour, said to Raghava,"Take me not for Viradha, Kabanda or Khara, Bali or Marica; it is I, Kumbhakarna, who stand here! Behold my dreadful and mighty mace wrought of iron; with this, Devas and Danavas were formerly struck down by me! Do not hold me in contempt in that I possess neither nose nor ears, I do not feel the least discomfort or pain on account of their loss! Manifest the strength of your limbs, O Tiger among the Ikshvakus; having displayed your prowess and might, I shall devour you, O Irreproachable Prince!"
Hearing him speak thus, Rama loosed one of his plumed arrows at Kumbhakarna that struck him with the force of lightning but that enemy of the Gods was neither shaken nor moved and those shafts, which had pierced seven Sala Trees and slain that bull among the monkeys, Bali, cut into the body of the titan that was as hard as a diamond.
Then, as though they were drops of water, that enemy of the mighty Indra, drank up those arrows through his body, thus quenching their fury, whilst he whirled his mace in a fine frenzy. And that weapon covered with blood, the terror of the celestial hosts, brandished by that titan with formidable energy, created panic in the simian ranks.
Then Rama, taking up another arrow named the Vayavya, loosed it against that ranger of the night and cut off the arm with which he held the mace. With his arm severed, he let out a terrible cry and his arm, cut off by Raghava's shaft, fell with its mace, like unto the peak of a mountain on the army of the King of the Monkeys, crushing it. Thereafter, beside themselves, the monkeys who had escaped the massacre caused by that fall, their limbs lacerated, took refuge in the vicinity and became the witnesses of the terrific struggle between that Indra among men and the Prince of the Titans.
His arm severed by that arrow, Kumbhakarna resembling the King of the Mountains its peak cloven by a great sword, struck down a tree with his remaining hand and rushed upon that lord of men, but Rama, with a shaft decorated with gold joined to Indra's weapon, cut off his upraised arm like the coiled body of a snake and the Tala Tree also.
Beholding the titan with two arms severed who, roaring, was rushing upon him, Rama took out two whetted and crescentshaped arrows and severed his two feet, whereupon the intermediary regions, the four quarters, the caves of the mountain, the vast ocean, the Qty of Lanka and the ranks of the monkeys resounded with the thunder of his fall.
His arms and legs severed, that titan opened his mouth like Vadavamukha and suddenly rushed howling on Rama like Rahu on the moon in the sky. Thereupon Rama filled his mouth with steel-pointed and plumed shafts decorated with gold and, with his mouth thus filled, he was unable to speak and, emitting inarticulated sounds with extreme difficulty, fell senseless.
Thereupon Rama selected an arrow bright as the rays of the sun, which resembled the Rod of Brahma at the time of the final dissolution and was fatal to his foes, the weapon of Indra, well-plumed and sharpened, the rival of Maruta in speed, and Rama discharged that arrow, the shaft of which was admirably inlaid with diamonds and gold, brilliant as the flames of a blazing sun, swift as Mahendra's thunderbolt, against that ranger of the night.
Loosed from Raghava's arm, that missile, which lit up the ten regions with its brilliance and which, in its formidable aspect, resembled a smokeless flame, struck that Prince of the Titans, the equal of Shakra and severed his head with its prominent teeth and swinging earrings, like unto the peak of a high mountain, as formerly Purandara severed the head of Vritra. The enormous head of Kumbhakarna with the curls that adorned it, looked like the moon floating in the sky at the time of the sun's rising, when the night has passed. Severed by Rama's shafts, the head of the titan resembling a mountain, fell on the earth crushing the highways, residences, gates and edifices of the city, bearing down the high walls also; and that gigantic body of great resplendence belonging to the titan, fell into the sea where it crushed the great sharks, huge fishes and serpents, and plunged into the depths below.
When Kumbhakarna, that great enemy of the brahmins and the Gods, was slain in combat, the earth shook as all the mountains also and the Celestials shouted for joy. Thereafter Gods, Rishis, Maharishis, Pannagas, Suras, Bhutas, Supamas, Guhyakas and the hosts of Yakshas and Gandharvas, who ranged the skies, loudly extolled Rama's exploit.
But on beholding that valiant Prince of the House of Raghu, the adherents and kinsfolk of the Lord of the Nairritas emitted loud cries at Kumbhakama's fall, as do elephants in the presence of a lion. Having overcome Kumbhakarna in the field, Rama, amidst the simian host, resembled the sun emerging from the jaws of Rahu when it drives away the darkness from the celestial region.
In their delight, the countless monkeys, whose faces resembled opening lotuses, lauded Prince Raghava, who saw the fulfilment of his desires in the death of his formidable adversary, and the elder brother of Bharata rejoiced that he had slain Kumbhakarna, the Scourge of the Gods, who had never been overcome in any great encounter, as the King of the Celestials rejoiced at the death of the great Asura, Vritra.
