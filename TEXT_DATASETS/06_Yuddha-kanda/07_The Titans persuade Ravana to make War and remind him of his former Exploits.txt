Hearing the words of Ravana, their lord and master, all those powerful titans, in their ignorance, instilled him with contempt for the enemy and with joined palms, offered him ill-considered advice, saying:â€”
"O King, we possess a vast army furnished with maces, spears, swords, lances, harpoons and barbed darts, why art you apprehensive? Didst you not enter Bhogavati, having overcome the Serpent Race in war? Didst you not subdue Dhanada, who inhabited the summit of Mt Kailasha, surrounded as he was by Yakshas, creating a terrible carnage amongst them? Though he regarded himself as the Lord of Men and prided himself on his friendship with Mahadeva, in your wrath you didst vanquish him on the field of battle.
"O Foremost among the Titans, Maya, the Lord of the Danavas in fear gave his daughter to you in wedlock and you didst also subjugate the powerful and arrogant giant, Madhu, the joy of Kumbhinasi! Descending into the nether regions you didst defeat the Serpents Vasuki, Takshaka, Shankha and Jati despite their irresistible power, courage and the boons conferred on them, O Lord! After fighting for a whole year, confident though they were in their own strength, you didst force them to submit to your yoke and learnt the science of magic from them, O King of the Titans, Vanquisher of thyFoes!
"O Great Hero, the valiant sons of Varuna were defeated by you in the open field as also the fourfold army attending on them, and you didst descend into the vast ocean, that dark region, whose sceptre is the aquatic world, his crown the Shalmali Tree, his noose the great billows, his serpents the attendants of Yama, who is irresistible in his feverish and fearful motion and you didst win a glorious victory there, overcoming Death and filling all your subjects with joy.
The earth was peopled with innumerable and valiant warriors, equal to Indra in prowess, resembling giant trees, yet you didst destroy those invincible heroes! Raghava is neither their equal in courage, virtue nor in might! Yet do you remain here, O Great King, why fatigue thyself? Indrajita is able to exterminate those monkeys single-handed. That prince, O Great Sovereign, returning from a sacrifice to Maheshwara, who is surpassed by none, received a boon from him not easily obtainable in this world and, approaching that divine sea, whose fish are lances and spears, which abounds in weapons for its trees, whose turtles are the elephants and whose frogs are the teeming horses, whose cetaceans are the Adityas and Maruts, its great serpents the Vasus, its waters the chariots, steeds and elephants, the sandy banks its infantry, that vast ocean of the Celestial Hosts, Indrajita approached, in order to bear away their king and bring him to Lanka. Thereafter that Monarch was liberated by the command of the Grandsire of the World and the Vanquisher of Shambara and Vritra returned to his abode where all the Gods paid homage to him.
"Therefore let your son, Indrajita, go forth and destroy the army of the monkeys and Rama also, O King; it is not worthy of you to imagine harm can come from common persons, such thoughts should not even enter your mind for assuredly you shalt bring about Rama's end!"
