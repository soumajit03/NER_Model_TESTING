Having resolved to stay on Mount Suvela, Rama, followed by Lakshmana, addressed Sugriva and also Bibishana the nightranger, who was full of integrity, devotion, sagacity and experience and, in tones of great sweetness and nobility, said,"Let us ascend the Mount Suvela, that king of peaks and plateaus, filled with hundreds of metallic veins, in order to pass the night there. Then we shall be able to survey Lanka, the haunt of that titan, that wretch who has borne away my consort to his own destruction! He has neither regard for justice, virtue nor the honour of his House, he, who, in consequence of his base nature, has committed this heinous deed."
Thus reflecting and censuring Ravana, Rama approached Mount Suvela with its ravishing slopes and began the ascent. Behind him came Lakshmana, proud of his great valour, alert, bearing his bow and arrows and Sugriva, who with his ministers and Bibishana scaled the mountain also. Those rangers of the hills bounded with the speed of the wind scrambling from a hundred sides at once in the steps of Raghava and did not take long to reach the summit.
From there they observed that splendid city with its marvellous gates enclosed in magnificent ramparts, as if suspended in the air; thus did Lanka, filled with warriors, appear to those monkey leaders and, standing on those wonderful ramparts, the dark-hued titans resembled a second wall in the eyes of the foremost monkeys. Beholding them, the monkeys, in Rama's presence, burning to fight, redoubled their cries.
Meanwhile the sun, dyed with the fires of dusk, moved towards the west, and the night, illumined by the full moon, drew on. Then Rama, the leader of the monkey army, having exchanged salutations with Bibishana, established himself happily on the breast of Mount Suvela with the leaders of the monkeys.
