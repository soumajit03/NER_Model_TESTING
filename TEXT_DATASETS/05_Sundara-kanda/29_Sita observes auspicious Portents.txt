Whilst the irreproachable and lovely princess remained bereft of joy and full of anxiety, she beheld auspicious portents on every side, resembling willing servants attendant on a wealthy man. And the large left eye of that lady of lovely looks, with its dark pupil, began to twitch like a lotus set spinning by a fish. And her beautiful plump and rounded arm, sprinkled with sandal and aloes which ere this, had served her lord as a pillow, began to tremble again and again. Her left thigh, like unto the tapering trunk of an elephant, moved convulsively foretelling that she would soon behold Rama and the golden sari, now covered with dust, of the large-eyed Maithili, whose teeth were like the seeds of a pomegranate, slipped from her beautiful shoulders.
Comforted by these signs and others also, that foretold a happy ending, Sita of lovely lashes resembling a plant dried by the wind and sun, reviving under tardy rain, experienced a great felicity. Then her countenance, her lips like Bimba fruit, her beautiful eyes, the curve of her lashes and her sharp teeth, recovered their beauty once more as the moon issuing from the mouth of Rahu.
Her despair and exhaustion removed, her fever allayed, her grief was assuaged and her heart filled with joy and that noble lady looked as beautiful as the moon of cool rays in its waxing period.
