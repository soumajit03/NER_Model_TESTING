At these words of Hanuman, Rama, born of Dasaratha, pressing the jewel to his heart, wept with Lakshmana. And beholding that marvellous gem, Raghava, stricken with grief, his eyes suffused with tears, said to Sugriva:â€”
"As milk flows from the udders of a cow on beholding its calf, so does my heart brim over on beholding this jewel! This pearl was conferred on Sita by my father-in-law on the occasion of our nuptuals and she wore it on her brow, thus enhancing her beauty. Obtained from the waters and reverenced by the Gods, it was conferred on Janaka by the sagacious Shakra, gratified by his adoration at a sacrifice.
"Seeing this magnificent gem, I recall the presence of my sire and my father-in-law, the King of Videha. This lovely ornament appeared beautiful on the forehead of my beloved and seeing it, it seems as if she herself were present here. As if sprinkling water on one who has lost consciousness, do you relate to me what Vaidehi has said, again and again, O Friend! What could be more poignant, O Saumitri, than seeing this pearl obtained from the waters, without Vaidehi? If she survive one month more, she will live long, but it is hard for me to exist an instant without Sita! Do you lead me to where you have seen my beloved; after hearing these tidings, I cannot brook a moment's delay. How can that lady of lovely hips, who was ever timorous, endure life amidst those grim and fearful demons? As the autumnal moon, enveloped in cloud is unable to shine forth, so Sita's countenance is no longer resplendent. O Hanuman, do you relate unto me again and again what Sita said to you. These words will revive me as the sick are cured by medicine. O Hanuman, what did my gentle, sweet-spoken and beautiful lady, who is separated from me, say to you? How is that daughter of Janaka able to survive in her dire misfortune?"
