Halting there, the intelligent monkey, born of Pavana, regarded that splendid chariot encrusted with gold and gems more carefully. Fashioned of plated gold, embellished with lovely images, regarded by Vishvakarma himself as an incomparable artistic achievement, travelling in space like a guiding light in the orbit of the sun, it was immeasurably resplendent. No detail of that car had been executed unskilfully, no ornament but appeared to be a jewel of great price nor was there anything surpassed by the chariots of the Gods, every part being excellently wrought.
By the merit of his asceticism and contemplation Ravana had obtained it and it repaired wheresoever its master directed it by the power of his thought. Irresistible and swift as the wind, a source of happiness to those magnanimous beings given to pious deeds, who had reached the peak of prosperity and glory, capable of ranging the firmament, containing many apartments and furnished with innumerable works of art, captivating to the mind, stainless as the autumnal moon, resembling a mountain with splendid peaks, borne by thousands of demons whose cheeks were graced with earrings, voracious eaters, of large unwinking eyes, who travelled through space with exceeding velocity day and night, that aerial chariot, Pushpaka, splendid to look upon, covered with flowers, fairer than spring itself, drew the gaze of that Prince of Monkey Warriors.
