Now, during the night that Shatrughna passed in the leaf-thatched hut, Sita gave birth to two children and, at midnight, the youthful ascetics brought the pleasant and auspicious tidings to Valmiki, saying:—
"O Blessed One, Rama's consort has given birth to twin sons, do you perform the rites that will preserve them from evil forces."
Hearing these words, the great Rishi went to see those newly-born Ones, who were as effulgent as the new moon and full of vigour, like unto twin offspring of the Gods.
Coming to w'here Sita was, on beholding those tw'o infants, his heart was filled with delight and he performed the Rakshasa Rite.1 Taking a handful of Kusha Grass with its roots, that Twice-born One, Valmiki, pronounced the formula of protection for the destruction of evil forces, saying:—
"Since they will rub the first born of the children with the Kusha Grass blessed by the aid of Mantras, his name shall be Kusha and, as the last born will be carefully dried by the female ascetics with the roots of the grass, he shall be called Lava. Therefore those two shall be called Kusha and Lava and, by these names that I have given them, they will become renowned."
Thereafter, the female ascetics purified themselves and reverently received the grass from the hands of the Muni, applying it to the two children. The rite having been performed in the night, Shatrughna hearing the pleasant tidings, the names the children would bear, and Rama's praises, also that Sita had undergone this double and fortunate birth, approached the leaf-thatched hut where Sita lay and said:—
"O Mother, be you happy!"
Thus, for the magnanimous Shatrughna, that night of the rainy season in the month of Shravana passed joyfully and rapidly and, the next day at dawn, that great hero, having offered up his morning devotions, with joined palms paid obeisance to the Sage and resumed his journey.
After a march of seven days, reaching the banks of the Yamuna, he halted at the hermitage of Rishis of great renown, and that illustrious Prince listened to the pleasant and ancient legends of Cyavana of the line of Bhrigu and of other Sages. In this way, Shatrughna, the son of that foremost of monarchs, King Dasaratha, in great delight, passed the night conversing with the ascetics, of whom Kancana was the leader, on various themes.
