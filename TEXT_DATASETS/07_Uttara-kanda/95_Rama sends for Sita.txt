Surrounded by the ascetics, kings and monkeys, Rama listened during many days to the sublime and wonderfill epic, and while the two sons of Sita, Kusha and Lava, were singing, he recognized them. Having reflected deeply, he summoned messengers of virtuous conduct and in the assembly spoke to them of that princess, saying:—
"Go and repeat my words to that Blessed One and say:—
"'If she be irreproachable in her conduct and without sin, then, should she so desire it and has the approval of the Rishi, let her prove her good faith!'
Do you then return and inform me concerning this matter. To-morrow at dawn, let Maithili, the daughter of Janaka attest her purity on oath in my presence, before the assembly!"
At this extremely significant command from Raghava, the messengers straightway went to seek out the foremost of the ascetics and, bowing to that Sage, who shone with infinite effulgence, they, with humility, communicated Rama's words to him.
Hearing them, the extremely illustrious ascetic, learning of Rama's wish, said "Be it so! May prosperity attend you!"
Thereafter those royal messengers returned with the Muni's answer and repeated it faithfully to Raghava and he, being informed of the decision of that magnanimous Sage, full of joy, addressed the Rishis and the assembled kings, saying:—
"O Blessed Ones, with your disciples, the kings and their attendants and whosoever may wish to do so, bear witness to the vow that Sita will make!"
These words of the magnanimous Raghava were praised by all the leading Rishis and those mighty kings who addressed the monarch saying:—
"Such conduct is only possible in You and is found nowhere else in the world, O Prince 1"
Having resolved thus, Raghava, the Scourge of his Foes, said:—
"To-morrow this shall take place," whereupon he dismissed the assembly.
The trial by oath being fixed for the following day, the magnanimous and illustrious Rama gave leave to all the great Sages and Kings to depart.
