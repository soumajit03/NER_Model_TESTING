"Having spoken thus to that foremost of Sages, in my distress, I began to weep, and that blessed One, reflecting for a while, said to me:—
"'Your two wings with their feathers will grow again and you will recover your sight, thine energy and your prowess. Having learnt it from the Puranas and foreseen it by mine ascetic power, I know that a great event is about to take place.
"'It concerns a certain king, named Dasaratha of the race of Ikshvaku, to whom a son, full of valour, will be bornty the name of Rama. He will repair to the forest with his brother Lakshmana, having been constrained to do so by his sire.
"'The son of Nairriti, Ravana, the King of the Titans, incapable of being slain by Gods or Danavas, will bear off his consort from the forest of Janasthana. And, albeit tempted by delicious viands and objects of enjoyment and desire, that noble and illustrious one, overcome by grief, will not partake of them. Then Vasava learning of this will offer her 'payasa' resembling ambrosia that the Gods themselves only obtain with difficulty. Receiving this food, Maithili, knowing it to come from Indra, will offer part of it to Rama, by pouring it on the ground, saying:—'Whether my husband or his younger brother still live or have attained the celestial state, may this food be acceptable to them.'
"'Rama's envoys having been sent hither, it will be for you to inform them of the facts relating to Sita, O Airy Traveller! Do not go hence for any reason, but whither canst you go in this condition? Wait for the time and place; you shalt recover your wings. I am able this very day to furnish you with wings but by waiting here you canst render a service to the worlds. Even so, you shalt be doing your duty to the two princes, the brahmins, your spiritual preceptors, the sages and Indra. I also am desirous of beholding the two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, after which I shall yield up my life.'
"Thus did that great Rishi, conversant with the nature of all things, speak to me."
