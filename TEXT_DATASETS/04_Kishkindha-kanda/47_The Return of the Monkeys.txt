In order to find Vaidehi, those leaders of monkeys, in obedience to their sovereign's will, speedily went forth in all directions to their destinations, and they explored lakes, streams, plains, cities and tracts rendered impassible by torrents. Then those chiefs of the monkey bands searched the regions described by Sugriva with their mountains, woods and forests. Engaged during the day in seeking for Sita, when night fell, they stretched themselves on the ground, and coming to trees covered with fruits in all seasons, they slept there.
Counting the day of their departure as the first, at the end of a month, giving up hope, they returned to their king on the Prasravana mountain.
Having scoured the eastern region with his forces, the mighty Vinata returned without having seen Sita. Thereafter the great monkey Shatabali came back disappointed with his forces, having scoured the whole of the northern quarter. And Sushena, at the end of the month, ranging the western region without success, presented himself in company with his monkeys before Sugriva.
Coming before Sugriva who was seated with Rama on a ridge of the Prasravana Mountain, and paying obeisance to them, Sushena said: "We have searched all the mountains, deep woods, valleys, ravines and the countries situated on the shores of the sea. All the places described by you have been scoured by us, as also all the jungles intertwined by creepers abounding in thickets that are impassable and the hilly districts. Huge animals have been encountered by us, which we have slain, and we have searched these densely wooded regions again and again, O Lord of the Monkeys. It is Hanuman, who is mighty and nobly born, who will discover Maithili; the son of the Wind has undoubtedly gone to where Sita has been taken."
